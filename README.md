# Coding_Challenge-8

This coding challenge is all about **realizing the power that you have as a developer to validate business ideas**. The reason I became a programmer was because I wanted to build businesses without having to hire a developer. If I had an idea, I want to test out the market and see if my idea is worth pursuing. Being a developer allows you to really test out your ideas. Whether you want to be an entrepreneur, co-founder, or someone who can build websites fast, this challenge will help you realize the power that you now have to build anything you dream up. In adition, you are going to have another website to add to your portfolio! 

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites on here.

## Prizes!
This challenge is kindly sponsored by Creative Tim (https://www.creative-tim.com/)! The top 3 entries of this challenge who will be selected by Creative Tim staff and myself will **each win the Big Bundle (https://www.creative-tim.com/product/buy/bundle/big-bundle) which has a $2,681 value each**. By the way, you can read the founder's story and how he build this business from the ground up here - they did something similar to what we are doing in this challenge: https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/using-a-freemium-business-model-to-grow-revenue-to-17-000-mo-fcd1be4ff4

## What is the Challenge?
Build a startup landing page that actually works! Start off by reading this excellent article: https://medium.com/@timferriss/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas-fae4dab10842
Then, go through the **Bootstrap 4, Templates, And Building Your Startup Landing Page** in the Zero to Mastery course if you need a refresher. You will need to build a landing page with your business product being showcased, and an email signup form. This email form should be signed up to something like Mailchimp(https://mailchimp.com/). which will allow you to collect user emails to see how many people are interested in your product. You will now have a way to test your idea and see if people like it! Remember: the idea can be silly. You will be judged on the website, not on the product or how valid of an idea it is. Have fun with it. 

## The Rules Are:

1. You HAVE TO use two things from Creative Tim - Starter Project: https://github.com/timcreative/udemy-nuk and the NOW UI Kit: https://www.creative-tim.com/product/now-ui-kit. You will use those to start off the project but you can customaize or add to it whatever you like afterwards. Be creative. 

2. **You have until August 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  -challenge github.com/<username>/<repo> . The bot will listen for the command in any channel its in and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded. Winner will be announced a couple of weeks after the contest ends.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

*** **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
